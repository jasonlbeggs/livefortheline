          <p class="mt-7">Little did I know it, but in a few moments my my whole life was about to change. I walked into the emergency room at Mass Eye & Ear Infirmary and never walked out.</p> 
          
          <p class="mt-7"></p>A day earlier, my optometrist called while I was outside playing with the boys in the snow (it seemed strange to call on a Sunday afternoon). I answered and Dr. Chang insisted that I go to the ER at MEEI first thing tomorrow morning. He told me he would call in the details and that they would be able to workup the issue immediately. I thought we just had a routine eye exam where glasses would correct the blurry vision and headaches I had been experiencing the past few months. He wrote something else on my discharge paper that I did not think much of at the time "papilledema."</p>
          
          <p class="mt-7">“Is it terminal?“ stumbled out of my mouth as the doctor in the ER informed me, “we found the cause of the papilledema.“ Pulling up my MRI scans, he showed me how a tumor was causing a dangerous amount of fluid to build up leading to the swollen cornea nerve and cranium pressure my optometrist noticed on Friday. The chill of this moment is still palpable for me today. I sat in shock. Exactly how long it all took escapes me, but soon the doctor was explaining how they would immediately admit me to the adjacent hospital, MGH, and get me to all the right people and places.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-7">
            “Would you like to call your wife?” My Lord, I can’t do this. This happens to other people—not to me. I called Kate and she answered trembling (I assume the hospital was some unknown number). “It’s me… They found a tumor.” I’m not sure all that came out of my mouth in that moment, but it was full of tears and unanswerable questions. Unsure of what happens next, she suggested I call my family.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-7">
            <small class="p-0.5 px-1 bg-yellow-500 text-slate-800 uppercase font-semibold inline-block text-base">No visitors, no exceptions.</small> COVID-19 has the hospital on lockdown. Not even my wife? I’m ushered to MGH on a stretcher, given the deep nasal COVID test and wait alone. Texts and calls start to come in. Kate quickly mobilized an army of believers. It was hundreds I’d find out later, all ready to go to prayer war on my behalf.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-7">
            As the heat of the moment cooled and I’ve spoken with my family and a few friends, a surgeon came in. She introduced herself, Dr. Pamela Jones. She walked me through what was happening. I’m not sure exactly when, but Eric called. He was on the phone with me when Dr. Jones was showing me the scans. I sent him pictures asking what he thought. My confidence always grows around Eric. He probably thought I was a fool asking his opinion with a world-class neurosurgeon in the room 😉.

            Dr. Jones had a special presence about her. It was like she commanded the room and everyone else paused. She would lead the surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor as soon as possible. Before leaving, probably realizing fear was  settling in, she squeezed my arm. It felt like no one else would come within 6-feet of me without a swab or a needle. With compassion Dr. Jones told me, “Don’t worry. I do this hundreds of times each year. It’s going to be OK.” It was like God sent an angel to comfort me right when I needed it most.

            Finally, I was admitted and given a room to myself. I wasn’t sure exactly when the surgery would be scheduled yet, but I was told it was likely tomorrow or the following day, which would be my 35th birthday.

            God met me in the valley that night as I sat utterly alone. Dozens of questions I didn’t want the answers to churned in my mind. I would not be allowed a single visitor and it remained that way for the duration of the most traumatic experience of my life.
