          <p class="mt-7">The puzzle is starting to come together. My surgery is officially scheduled for tomorrow, 2/10/21, my 35th birthday. It was bittersweet as nurses and doctors started to realize that I was having surgery on my birthday. I was met with awkward ‚Äúhappy birthdays‚Äù and an overload of information on how craniotomies work. I can‚Äôt remember my responses, but it probably ranged from silence to a sarcastic ‚Äúthanks‚Äù.</p>

          <p class="mt-7">I sat around most of the day waiting with a few tests sprinkled in. Most memorable was a cognitive exam where you‚Äôre tested with brain-teasing puzzles and memory games. I remember thinking, I‚Äôve never been good at things like this, who can easily remember 7-10 random words and then repeat them back? They were tedious and frustrating at first, but ended up being a good distraction.</p>
            
          <p class="mt-7">As the day waned I found out my surgery preparations would start very early the next morning, around 4 AM. I‚Äôd have to stop eating around 6-7 PM and could only have water from then on.</p>
            
          <p class="mt-7">That night I had a birthday celebration over FaceTime with my family. I  was even able to get a piece of cake üéÇ with my dinner. Later I started making a few frantic phone calls to people I love with some urgency, anticipating if things did not go as planned with surgery. I could only imagine the worst case scenarios. What if I never came back conscious after I‚Äôm put under? So much to say with so little time. I wrote quick notes to the boys and Kate that I hoped would never see the light of day.</p>
            
          <p class="mt-7">I probably listened to this sermon two or three times that day and night: <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/the-glory-of-god-in-the-sight-of-eternity">The Glory of God in the Sight of¬†Eternity</a> based on <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A16-18&amp;version=ESV">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</a>. It‚Äôs one of my all-time favorites by John Piper, in part because I was there when he preached it in 2013 at the Legacy conference in Chicago with Eric, Jordan, and Keywan. Mostly, though, because of the powerful hope in God it proclaims for the suffering and dying.</p>
            
          <p class="mt-7">We were sitting in the balcony to his left and at one point in the sermon (captured profoundly in <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://youtu.be/qyUPz6_TciY?t=203">clip during this song by Shane and Shane</a>) he says the following:</p>
            
              <blockquote class="mt-7 ml-0 py-1 pl-8 text-xl border border-0 border-l-2 border-yellow-500">
                <p>‚ÄúNot only is all your affliction <b>momentary</b>, not only is all your affliction <b>light</b> in comparison to eternity and the glory there. But all of it is totally <b>meaningful</b>. Every millisecond of your pain ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care if it was cancer or criticism. I don‚Äôt care if it was slander or sickness. It wasn‚Äôt meaningless. <b>It‚Äôs doing something! It‚Äôs not meaningless.</b> Of course you can‚Äôt see what it‚Äôs doing. <b>Don‚Äôt look to what is seen.</b></p>
                
                <p class="mt-4">When your mom dies, when your kid dies, <b class="border-b-2 border-dotted border-yellow-500">when you‚Äôve got cancer at 40</b> ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs meaningless!‚Äù It‚Äôs not. <b>It‚Äôs working for you an eternal weight of glory.</b></p>
                
                <p class="mt-4">Therefore, <b>do not lose heart</b>. But take these truths and <b>day by day</b> focus on them. Preach them to yourself every morning. Get alone with God and preach his word into your mind until your heart <b>sings with confidence</b> that you are new and cared for.‚Äú</p>

          <p class="mt-7">I needed to be reminded these truths on the doorstep of uncertainty and unknowns - this is not meaningless.</p>
              
          <p class="mt-7">Apparently, I also needed another COVID test üò≠. I remember thinking to myself ‚Äúall I‚Äôve been exposed to are hospital staff!‚Äù There was a male nurse in and out that evening who was very kind to me. I think his name was John, but I don't remember for certain. He left his shift that night and reassured me ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got this.‚Äù</p>
              
          <p class="mt-7">Overall, I went to sleep feeling at peace, prepared and buoyed by the Lord to face what comes in the morning.</p>
